For each task in the assignment you have to deliver:
A single file (*_DockerFile.txt) contains all commands you used to build containers, configure your cluster, and run your task (program).
A single file (*_commands_explanation.pdf) that explains all commands used in the first file (*_DockerFile.txt). 
For task T2:
You have to run the 4 questions in assignment2 using MPI only. Use the cluster you built (1 Master and 3 Workers)  to run the 4 questions. (you do not have to build a separate cluster for each question).
Regarding the report: Provide a line figure for each question that shows how the total execution time varies by varying the number of workers from 1 to 3. For each figure explains the figure and comment if there is a speedup happened.
